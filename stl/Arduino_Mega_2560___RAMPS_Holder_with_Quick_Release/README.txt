# Summary

The Arduino pcb just snaps in and can be released by pushing the hook. There are also tree screw holes with embedded nuts to screw the board down, but this is not quite needed. Even the complete RAMPS assembly is held proper.

There is also a fan holder:

The mount is intended for RAMPS boards on an 3d printer, but will serve any applications of an Arduino Mega 2560.

If you wish to mount the device to an alu profile frame see:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2169986

The stl file already presents the next stepping with more support pilers and additional ventilation for the voltage regulator of the Arduino.

# Print Settings

Printer: Sintron Prusa i3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.25mm

Notes: 
Less brittle material is recommended. I used PETG, witch worked great.

# Post-Printing

The model includes all support structures. You have to drill through the tree screw holes to remove the support pilers from the hex indents. The support under the clamping hook can be removed with an knife.
